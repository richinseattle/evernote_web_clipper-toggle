### Evernote Web Clipper Toggle

This is just quick plugin for Chrome/Chromium/Brave that acts as a quick toggle for Evernote Web Clipper.. there's too much going on in there to have it always on, now you can enable/disable at click of a button.   

To use, enable developer mode in extensions and import unpacked plugin from repository directory. Optionally pack the plugin and sign it for your own use to disable developer mode. 

Based on Switcher for LastPass / Quick JS Switcher.
